        "**Section 1** of the paper basically breaks down part of the motivation behind including attention mechanisms in NLP models. I am familiar with how LSTM and other RNN architectures work and it seems like the impetus (at the time) was to capture inter-word dependencies in a way that is not inherently sequential. This allows for training efficiency to improve by leveraging parallel computation (*which I am funnily enough eschewing in this exercise I am undertaking*). This parallelization effectively increases the effectiveness of the model by allowing for training on larger sets of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Section 2** of the paper breaks down how attention compares to existing approaches employing convolution and sequence-aligned RNNS ([which I think refers to Seq2Seq models](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-implement-seq2seq-lstm-model-in-keras-shortcutnlp-6f355f3e5639)).\n",
        "\n",
        "Attention has an advantage in learning relations between distant word positions (constant number of operations) but it loses some resolution. The Transformer employs **Multi-Head-Attention** to counteract this. This is described later in the paper."
